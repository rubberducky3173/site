**Lab 3- Dataset Analysis of Formula 1's Most Iconic Track: Monaco**

Circuit de Monaco is without a doubt the most well-known race track in Formula 1. With a length of 3.337 km, 19 turns, narrow streets, and a Grand Prix debut in 1950, Monaco has provided F1 Championships where speed and driving skill go hand in hand. 

I will be answering these questions in this post:

1. Which dataset did you work with?
2. Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?
3. Discuss your analysis of the dataset. Include details such as:
    a. The variables you looked at
    b. Distributions of variables (center and variability)
    c. Relationships between variables
    d. Visualizations of the dataset
    e. Limitations of your analysis and the dataset
    f. What conclusions can you draw about this dataset? What is your supporting evidence?

**1. Which dataset did you work with?**

I wanted to analyze the lap times to see the rate at which F1 car development is progressing. I am using this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/code?datasetId=468218&sortBy=dateRun&tab=collaboration&select=lap_times.csv
