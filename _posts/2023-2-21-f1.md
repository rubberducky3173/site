**Lab 3- Dataset Analysis of Formula 1's Most Iconic Track: Monaco**

Circuit de Monaco is without a doubt the most well-known race track in Formula 1. With a length of 3.337 km, 19 turns, narrow streets, and a Grand Prix debut in 1950, Monaco has provided F1 Championships where speed and driving skill go hand in hand. 

I will be answering these questions in this post:

1. Which dataset did you work with?
2. Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?
3. Discuss your analysis of the dataset. Include details such as:
    a. The variables you looked at
    b. Distributions of variables (center and variability)
    c. Relationships between variables
    d. Visualizations of the dataset
    e. Limitations of your analysis and the dataset
    f. What conclusions can you draw about this dataset? What is your supporting evidence?

**1. Which dataset did you work with?**

I wanted to analyze the lap times to see the rate at which F1 car development is progressing. I am using this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohanrao/formula-1-world-championship-1950-2020/code?datasetId=468218&sortBy=dateRun&tab=collaboration&select=lap_times.csv

**2. Which aspect of this dataset are you interested in? What do you hope to learn from analyzing this dataset?**
I'm interested in the lap times of Monaco given the difficulty of driving the track and its iconic status. I hope to see how car development has progressed based on the average lap times of the cars, and predict how fast cars may be going in the future. Driver skill isn't quantitative, so the times are usually indicative of how well a driver is able to get through this circuit.

**3. Discuss your analysis of the dataset.**
Here comes the fun part! I had multiple CSVs to look through in order to organize the dataset into the things I wanted.
