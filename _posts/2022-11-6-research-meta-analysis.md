Given that lots of our research is fake because of publish or perish, what should we be trusting to use in changes to society? In this blog post I’ll be looking at a study of using cats in animal-assisted interventions (AAIs) and whether the data are credible enough. Below are the answers to the questions asked for this assignment.

**University Cats? Predictors of Staff and Student Responsiveness Toward On-Campus Cat Visitations**

Study used:
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08927936.2022.2109290
Found the study on:

Pay attention to how the article right above is assuming the research is legitimate. It may be and it may not be because of the unique contexts of this study.


**What are the null and alternative hypotheses?**

Null: There is no link between cats and improved mental health of higher-education institutions. (They shouldn’t be used more.)
Alternative: There is a link between cats and improved mental health of higher-education institutions. (They should be used more.)

**Who is collecting and analyzing this data?**
Two people headed the research: Patricia Pendry, a professor at Washington State University who included cats in her own institution’s animal-assisted interventions programs; and Joni Delanoeije, a postdoctoral researcher and lecturer at KU Leuven in Belgium. They are the authors of the research article as well. Two other people were acknowledged in designing the survey and collecting data: Christel P. H. Moons and Els H. K. A. Peeters.

**What datasets does this study reference or use? Are these datasets available to the public?**
	This study references a bunch of public datasets; most of which are past studies for AAIs. It’s important to note that a lot of those AAI studies are associated with using dogs instead of other animals. There are also references to past research on behavioral and brain sciences. I believe these are all available to the public; at least I can 100% confirm for the datasets analyzed in this study. 

The data collected here includes the experiment participants’ demographics (more specifics later on), statuses for pets, and quantified responsiveness. We can view them all on the research article by clicking on one of the graphs. (You can download a CSV!)

**Why are they interested in this data?**
	As said directly in the study, the goal for analyzing this data is “(1) to assess respondents’ responsiveness toward a cat visitation program, and (2) to understand the role of participants’ characteristics, personality, and experiences in shaping their responsiveness.” It’s to create first steps for whether cats should be used for AAIs. The world is kind of stressed out right now, especially in schools, so it’s reasonable to try and find ways to relieve students and faculty in schools of stress.

**What data is being recorded? What data might be left out?**
Some of the data being recorded are the participants’ demographics, which were collected before the experiment: Age, gender, diploma, family situation, partner, children, nationality. Some of the other data were collected during the experiment, which include: Stress level, emotionality level, responsiveness of the animal presence, and risks of on-campus animals. Some things to note are how the researchers did not choose to list different majors that may vary in workload given that more work = more stress, as well as excluding those who attended online programs because of the necessity of being in-person (because of COVID-19). That takes a huge chunk out of the population studied. They also only studied Flemish higher-education institutions which excludes the rest of the world that may perceive things differently. The researchers called for more experiments in non-European and non-COVID-19 contexts. Finally, on demographics, there was a note at the bottom: “As 31.5% of respondents did not fill out the survey completely and respondents were allowed to leave questions blank, the sample size varies depending on the measure.”

**What evidence did they present to back up their conclusions?**
They often referenced previous studies where cats were shown to demonstrate similar traits to dogs in terms of AAIs (e.g. attentiveness). There was also data about responsiveness to cat and dog initiatives and risk assessment for having these animals on campus. Some of the data collected:

Note!: The study did not include emotionality in results. That makes me wonder why that was collected as well. Plus, the researchers mentioned that cats also have a bad reputation for not being as friendly or behaved as dogs, but also are a point of interest for a special context given that dogs are dominating the AAI sphere.

Here are the correlations:

These were the predictor results:

**How was this study funded?**
	This study was funded by FEB Antwerp Campus, Faculty of Economics and Business KU Leuven; Internal Funds KU Leuven; and Research Foundation Flanders.

**Do you think publish or perish had an effect on this study?**
It might have. Some of the p values were quite small, which seems suspicious if it is getting recreated. Plus, the conditions in which this study was conducted have changed since. The researchers note that the study needs to be conducted again in different conditions, but that does in a way reaffirm that this study was not representative of linking cats to AAis in higher education.
