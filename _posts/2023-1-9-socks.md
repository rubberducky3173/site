**Lab 2- Animal Crossing Socks**

Welcome back to another Art of Data Lab. Today I'm going to take a look at at Animal Crossing socks that and add onto my increasing debt. Please don't tell Tom Nook that I've changed my name and moved 8 times to commit Animal Crossing tax evasion.

**Obtaining the dataset**

To obtain the dataset, I first imported requests and used the typical response = requests.get syntax. I found that I had a lot of errors when trying to add the key after the base url, so I just included my key as a part of the base url. Getting the index was a bit hard, so i decided to do a guess and check for valid and invalid URLs, narrowing the number down to a max index of 363. I used a while loop to grab all the data in the range.

After that, I appended the Name, Color 1, Color 2, and Variations to a list to write to a CSV using csv.writer/ This part was quite easy to finish. Dataset obtained!

**Sock Variations**


**Sock Colors**

**Process**

How many socks of each color are there? If a sock has two different colors, it should be counted in both. However, if a sock has the same Color1 and Color2, make sure you don’t double count it!

Discuss your process of how you worked on this lab. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didn’t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. Focus more on the programming side of the lab! Feel free to attach images, screenshots, pseudocode, etc to elaborate on your response.
