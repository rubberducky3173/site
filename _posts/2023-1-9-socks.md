**Lab 2- Animal Crossing Socks**

Welcome back to another Art of Data Lab- this is Lab 2. Today I'm going to take a look at at Animal Crossing sock data. (By the way, beware of Tom Nook and his monopolistic dictatorship. Big Brother is watching)

**Obtaining the dataset**

I started by defining the index as 0, which is th first value that gives a valid response. I had a bit of trouble with the URL, so I took a quick look online and created a base URL with correct characters, as well as including my key for cleanliness reasons. If I didn't include the key at the start, I would have used params=payload.

After opening my new CSV file called socksheet.csv, getting the data itself was easy. For the loop, I checked the index limit by accessing my own part of the website and changing the index around min and max ranges, then narrowing it down until I found what worked. In this case, 363 was the maximum index value, starting from 0. To make it easier for myself to access rows, I only wrote the Name, Color1, and Color2 variations into the CSV. Even though variations are used, I didn't need to know what kinds of variations there were; rather only how many variations there were. After writing, the index was increased by 1 and ran until the limit.

**Sock Variations**

**Sock Colors**

**Process**

How many socks of each color are there? If a sock has two different colors, it should be counted in both. However, if a sock has the same Color1 and Color2, make sure you don’t double count it!

Discuss your process of how you worked on this lab. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didn’t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. Focus more on the programming side of the lab! Feel free to attach images, screenshots, pseudocode, etc to elaborate on your response.
