**Lab 2- Animal Crossing Socks**

Welcome back to another Art of Data Lab about Animal Crossing socks. I haven't played much AC but I think I kind of know how it works. (Beware of Tom Nook and his monopolistic dictatorship. Big Brother is watching)

Below are my answers to the questions asked by the lab.

**Obtaining the dataset**

I started by defining the index as 0, which is th first value that gives a valid response. I had a bit of trouble with the URL, so I took a quick look online and created a base URL with correct characters, as well as including my key for cleanliness reasons. If I didn't include the key at the start, I would have used params=payload.

After opening my new CSV file called socksheet.csv, getting the data itself was easy. For the loop, I checked the index limit by accessing my own part of the website and changing the index around min and max ranges, then narrowing it down until I found what worked. In this case, 363 was the maximum index value, starting from 0. To make it easier for myself to access rows, I only wrote the Name, Color1, and Color2 variations into the CSV. Even though variations are used, I didn't need to know what kinds of variations there were; rather only how many variations there were. After writing, the index was increased by 1 and ran until the limit.

**Sock Variations- Which sock has the most variations? If there is more than one answer, then list all of them.**

ANSWER: Maximum variation is 8, for argyle crew socks, color-blocked socks, frilly knee-high socks, holey tights, kiddie socks, mixed-tweed socks, no-show socks, semi-opaque socks, semi-opaque tights, sequin leggings, simple-accent socks, striped socks, striped tights, tube socks, ultra no-show socks, vivid leggings, vivid socks, and vivid tights.

I first opened up a CSV reader with my dataset, then I defined my dictionary of vars (and colors, used in the next problem). Next, I created counter and counterlist, things that would keep track of how many variations in the dictionary there are. This part took a very long time for me because I did a lot of checking and debugging over and over again to make sure my rows were in the range. I found that a lot of the problems were indenting! I used next() in order to skip the header, which gave me some trouble at first.

![Counting](https://github.com/rubberducky3173/site/blob/master/assets/img/counting.PNG?raw=true)

Row[0] signifies the names of the socks and I checked whether they existed in vars- if they did, I added 1 onto the dictionary. If not, nothing changed with the counter. After that, I looped through the dictionary's range i to make sure that the variations counted were the highest, and if any other sock matched, appended their name to the list to be printed. Remember to convert everything to a string if you concatenate!

**Sock Colors- How many socks of each color are there? If a sock has two different colors, it should be counted in both. However, if a sock has the same Color1 and Color2, make sure you don’t double count it!**

ANSWER: The total numbers of each color sock are Pink: 44, Red: 43, Aqua: 33, Orange: 28, Purple: 39, Green: 51, Blue: 48, Yellow: 34, White: 89, Black: 65, Beige: 16, Gray: 33, Brown: 11, Colorful: 14}

This process was easier because it was similar to the previous question's process. I defined the colors dictionary as mentioned earlier and pretty much repeated this step like a variation but for colors. (Opening the CSV, CSV reader, next, etc.). Row[1] represents Color 1. (See how writing specific data helps with the hassle of finding the row?)

![Colors1](https://github.com/rubberducky3173/site/blob/master/assets/img/colors.PNG?raw=true)

Now that I collected all of the colors in Colors 1, it's time to move onto Colors 2. Row[2] represents Color 2. This question specifically asked us to NOT double count, so it's necessary to check whether there's a repeat between both the color rows. I did this by using != in an if statement kind of like a security measure to not let any doppelgangers through. Then, just like variation, I checked whether the accepted colors existed in the colors dictionary and increased it by 1 if something did.

Finally the whole struggle was over and I was able to beautifully print the answer.
