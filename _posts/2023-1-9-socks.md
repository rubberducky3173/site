**Lab 2- Animal Crossing Socks**

Welcome back to another Art of Data Lab about Animal Crossing socks. I haven't played much AC but I think I kind of know how it works. (Beware of Tom Nook and his monopolistic dictatorship. Big Brother is watching)

Below are my answers to the questions asked by the lab.

**Obtaining the dataset**

I started by defining the index as 0, which is th first value that gives a valid response. I had a bit of trouble with the URL, so I took a quick look online and created a base URL with correct characters, as well as including my key for cleanliness reasons. If I didn't include the key at the start, I would have used params=payload.

After opening my new CSV file called socksheet.csv, getting the data itself was easy. For the loop, I checked the index limit by accessing my own part of the website and changing the index around min and max ranges, then narrowing it down until I found what worked. In this case, 363 was the maximum index value, starting from 0. To make it easier for myself to access rows, I only wrote the Name, Color1, and Color2 variations into the CSV. Even though variations are used, I didn't need to know what kinds of variations there were; rather only how many variations there were. After writing, the index was increased by 1 and ran until the limit.

**Sock Variations- Which sock has the most variations? If there is more than one answer, then list all of them.**
ANSWER: Maximum variation is 8, for argyle crew socks, color-blocked socks, frilly knee-high socks, holey tights, kiddie socks, mixed-tweed socks, no-show socks, semi-opaque socks, semi-opaque tights, sequin leggings, simple-accent socks, striped socks, striped tights, tube socks, ultra no-show socks, vivid leggings, vivid socks, and vivid tights.

I first opened up a CSV reader with my dataset, then I defined my dictionary of vars (and colors, used in the next problem). Next, I created counter and counterlist, things that would keep track of how many variations in the dictionary there are. This part took a very long time for me because I did a lot of checking and debugging over and over again to make sure my rows were in the range. I found that a lot of the problems were indenting! I used next() in order to skip the header, which gave me some trouble at first.

![Counting](https://github.com/rubberducky3173/site/blob/master/assets/img/counting.PNG?raw=true)

Row[0] signifies the names of the socks and I checked whether they existed in vars- if they did, I added 1 onto the dictionary. If not, nothing changed with the counter. After that, I looped through the dictionary's range i to make sure that the variations counted were the highest, and if any other sock matched, appended their name to the list to be printed.

Discuss your process of how you worked on this lab. Include details such as who you worked with, what methods you tried, what worked or didn’t work, what could have gone better, and what you learned during this lab. Focus more on the programming side of the lab! Feel free to attach images, screenshots, pseudocode, etc to elaborate on your response.
