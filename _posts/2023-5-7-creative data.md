Welcome back to my blog everyone! The newest assignment required me to do something creatively that’s data-related. So I was wondering, since it was May 4th recently, what about something Star Wars-themed? Yes I know it’s past May 4th but this is still going to be Star Wars.

So here comes the question:

**In Star Wars: A New Hope, what was the probability of Luke destroying Death Star I successfully?**

It seemed pretty easy for him, right? But you've probably forgotten how many close calls with death this farm boy has had. But alas, boom goes the machine that costs several octillion dollars to run a day.

The Rebel Alliance was quite elated for this victory, with Han Solo saying

**"Great shot, kid! That was one in a million!"**

Is it really one in a million? What if the Death Star Plans got destroyed with R2-D2? What if Luke never went along with Obi-Wan Kenobi? Got shot down in his X-wing? Got crushed in the garbage dump? 

The chances are virtually 0. But I like seeing numbers. So, I decided to watch the whole movie again and created percentages where there’s a risk to the Death Star plans or Luke or hitting the Death Star.

**The Diplomatic Mission**

An Imperial-class Star Destroyer is chasing Princess Leia’s ship, firing shots, but not to destroy it. A shot certainly damages its chances of getting away, so I roughly calculated a “hit rate” for this gunfire scene. About 58 shots, 5 made contact. So the hit rate is about 8.6% or rounded to 9%. That’s a pretty good chance of survival (91%), but the plans are in danger! Therefore I decided that the chances the plan is gonna get away is 16%. 

(I usually calculated the survival rate by calculating the hit rate then subtracting that percent from 100. If the hit rate is higher, you do have more of a chance of getting killed by a shot but you also have a higher chance of destroying the enemy. Similarly for lower hit rates- there are more enemies, but if you guys can’t hit one another you stay alive! I also listened to sound effects for shots that weren’t present on screen to count those. In addition, these survival rates are contributing to the percentage chance of exploding the Death Star because we’re following what helps with doing the destroying through the movie. PLEASE do note that these numbers are very hard to count and a lot were estimated by tapping wildly on a counter button!)

Then R2-D2 and C-3PO decide to cross a hallway in the middle of fire, but R2 doesn’t have the plans yet. That was silly of them to do so and R2 ran the risk of not being able to GET the plans, so they had a 10% chance of survival in that scene. 
Then after Leia gives the plans to R2-D2, the droid decides to go through a forbidden door which C-3PO objects to. That’s a 50-50 because there’s conflicting ideas, but R2 decides to go through and a shot is fired and nearly misses C-3PO, who follows R2 in. That shot lowers the chance to 25%.
The droids escape from the ship, but had a 50% chance of surviving because the Star Destroyer took interest but didn’t detect any life forms (yes, droids are in it and are not living organisms) and decided not to absolutely blast that escape pod to pieces. Unfortunately, Leia is captured by Darth Vader.
Safely landing on Tatooine, R2-D2 and C-3PO go their separate ways. They both are captured by trading Jawas, which is a pretty good survival rate because they have value. 90%.
When Luke and his family finally make an appearance, R2-D2 is not chosen to come with Luke until one of the other traded droids breaks. R2-D2 and C-3PO can’t be separated. 40% chance.

**On Tatooine**

Luke fixes up R2-D2 a bit and sees something on R2. Trying to get it out, Luke triggers Princess Leia’s message: “Help me Obi-Wan Kenobi, you’re my only hope.” It cuts off. Pretty good chance of seeing the plans of 80%. Luke is clueless, but speculates this is related to someone named Uncle Ben and is interested with a chance of 70%. Later, R2-D2 disappears into the desert, set on getting the message to whoever Obi-Wan is. Luke’s very worried because his uncle Owen Lars would get upset at him. The next day Luke goes to find R2-D2 unharmed and plans to take him back, only to get attacked by Tuscans and knocked out. 60% chance. However, Uncle Ben himself comes to the rescue somehow (50%) and reveals himself as Obi-Wan Kenobi. 
Back at home, Obi-Wan Kenobi reminisces about the days of the Jedi and talks about the Force and shows Luke his lightsaber. Luke of course swings it around like some toy but the blade is made out of plasma and can be pretty bad when mishandled. 97% of survival for you, Luke. Suddenly Leia’s message appears in full when C-3PO hits R2 on the head, so it’s an 80% chance. Obi-Wan sees this full message about containing the Death Star plans and turns to Luke for help to get to planet Alderaan. Luke is reluctant to go, but still offers to help a little bit. 40%. Later on, the Stormtroopers raid Luke’s home and kill his family there, making Luke determined to stop the Empire for the rest of the film.

**Meeting Han Solo and Chewbacca**

Luke, Obi-Wan, and the droids go to a bar to look for a ship to take them to Alderaan, Princess Leia’s peaceful planet. However, Stormtroopers were present. The Empire has figured out that droids took an escape pod down from the ship and had the plans, because the plans were missing from Leia’s ship. However Obi-Wan pulls a mind trick and convinces the Stormtroopers with a solid 90% success rate that “These aren’t the droids you’re looking for.” 
In the bar, things are quite unsafe and even killing someone only draws attention for a few seconds then everyone goes back to minding their own business. Luke gets into a small altercation but is saved by Obi-Wan and his lightsaber. 85%.
They meet with Han Solo and his Wookiee friend Chewbacca who agree to be their ride with the Millenium Falcon. Stormtroopers enter the bar, but Luke and Obi-Wan get out quite fast with a survival rate of 90%. As Han Solo is about to leave, a bounty hunter named Greedo tries to kill him for a huge amount on Han Solo’s head. But Solo secretly pulls a gun and kills Greedo with a closer call of 50%. R2-D2 and C-3PO have a 50% chance of getting out when hiding because the Stormtroopers can go one way or the other. As the group is about to leave, Stormtroopers find them and begin shooting but actually have a 0% hit rate so luckily the group gets away.
However, when planning to hyperjump to Alderaan, some Imperial ships chase after them but they get away with a 50% chance.
What they don’t know is that the Death Star just blew up Alderaan to showcase the Death Star’s power in front of Leia- but Obi-Wan realizes that something terrible has just happened.

**Alderaan in Pieces and the Death Star**

Han Solo and Chewie leave hyperjump but need to navigate through the asteroid field- which is Alderaan now- with a 60% chance of survival. They suddenly get pulled into the Death Star for investigation.
The group hides in the floor with an 80% chance of survival because Han Solo used the floor to smuggle things. They ambush the Stormtroopers with a beautiful 97% success rate and disguise themselves in order to turn off the tractor beam. R2-D2, while looking for where to shut off the tractor beam, discovers Princess Leia imprisoned here. Obi-Wan leaves to turn off the tractor beam and Han Solo and Luke go downstairs to get her, posing as Stormtroopers doing a prisoner transfer but it’s pretty suspicious. 25%. They suddenly attack the Imperial officials guarding the prison with a hit rate of 3/61 shots. This comes out to a 95% chance of survival. Luke and Han rescue Leia but encounter more Stormtroopers with a hit rate of 3/116 shots, which means their survival rate is 97%. They escape through the garbage chute.

**Garbage Walls and the Garbage Monster**

Disgusting. But who cares about that when you’re getting pulled under by the monster that lives in the Death Star’s garbage? Luke goes under twice but barely survives so he had a 13% chance of surviving. Then the walls start closing in. I began to count down from 100 slowly to see what percent chance they had. It wasn’t exactly a 1-1 second-to-percent ratio, but I counted 95 when R2-D2 turned off the garbage compactor so the group had a 5% chance of living. They finally try to make their way back to the Millenium Falcon but get in trouble.

**Leaving the Death Star**

Han Solo chases and shoots at a bunch of Stormtroopers but realizes they have backup and therefore goes the other way.
Meanwhile, Luke almost falls off a bridge but survives so he has a 50% chance. He tries to swing across a gap with Leia while Stormtroopers shoot at him. There were 4 hits and 147 shots fired, so Luke and Leia had a 97% chance of living. They meet up with Han Solo and try to get into the Millenium Falcon. The Stormtroopers guarding the ship go to investigate a lightsaber fight between Obi-Wan and his apprentice, Darth Vader himself! However Obi-Wan lets himself be killed and tells Luke to run as a voice from the Force even though he’s devastated. The group escapes while Stormtroopers fire at them. Hit rate was 4/110 and the rate was 96%. They’re not quite out of this yet! A few TIE fighters follow the group as they’re trying to get out. TIE fighters shoot two shots at a time, so I had to account for those. In a quick dogfight with Luke and Han Solo at the turrets, the Millenium Falcon escapes with 8 hits and 187 shots fired. That is about a 96% chance of survival. However, they were followed by the Death Star to the Rebel base on the 4th moon of Yavin. Whoops.


**Battle of Yavin**

Han Solo takes his money and leaves (bye), while Luke becomes a T-65B X-wing pilot. There’s only so much time left until the Death Star gets in range to destroy Yavin 4. Finally getting a look at the plans of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance’s chances of victory are slim as the Death Star’s weakness is the reactor in the middle. It’s exposed by a thermal exhaust port that’s only 2 meters wide. Moreover, it’s in the meridian trench of the station. By the way, the Death Star is 160 km in diameter so anything hitting the reactor needs to travel 80 km down while surviving an onslaught.
Luke and the other pilots go on a crazy adventure to destroy the Death Star as a final effort. Turbolasers on the Death Star, TIE fighters, X-wings, and Y-wings fire a generous amount of approximately 515 shots and hit 37. However, Darth Vader is a part of this and has quite some good aim in comparison to everyone else. That’s still about a 93% percent chance of survival- a bit lower, but a good chance of surviving. 
Luke gets hit sometimes but still stays alive. He got a “little cooked” but was okay, so that’s a 95% chance. Later, one of his engines got hit and since X-wings have 4 engines that’s a 75% chance of survival.
While everyone was making their attack runs, one of the Red Leaders, Garven Dreis, attempted to fire his Proton torpedoes into the exhaust port but missed. Even with the AI in the aim system probably having a 90% success rate, it was a slim chance, but thanks for trying to help anyways. Maybe Dreis is just your average joe of a pilot? 10%. 
Darth Vader and his TIE fighters were picking everyone off one by one and was about to shoot Luke down until Han Solo miraculously returned in the Millenium Falcon to shoot down the TIE Fighters and damage Vader. Whether he came back or not was probably 50%.
All of a sudden Luke hears Obi-Wan Kenobi, telling him to “use the Force.” Luke realizes that it’ll help, so removes his computer but assures everyone he’s fine to the confusion of the Rebels. Luke activates his aimbot cheats with the Force and fires two Proton torpedoes that make a wonderful direct hit, destroying the Death Star immediately. Despite having a strong connection with the Force, Luke was a bit of a noob so that was a 90% chance of destroying the Death Star. But he did it!

**The Numbers**

![probability](https://github.com/rubberducky3173/site/blob/master/assets/img/probability.PNG?raw=true)

With our percentages all written down, all I needed to do was multiply them together. I had written them as out of 1, so 90% was 0.9, for example. With that format I got the approximate chance, but multiplied it by 100 to get as percent instead of out of 1. Therefore… the chance of Luke destroying the Death Star was…

**0.000000005404757%**

That’s kind of small. Congrats Luke! 

As inaccurate or as nonsensical this may seem, this was extremely fun. It’s calculating numbers instead of relying on movie magic- a hard task but very worth it in the end. I hope to do something similar with more Star Wars movies in the future!
